### Hey there! 👋

I’m Max Sun, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.

I build things that mix software, games, and immersive tech.

If I have an idea, I prototype it, whether that’s a Unity game, a VR training tool, or an AI-powered web app and then iterate until it feels shippable.

My main tech stack includes C++, C#, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Unity.
I frequently work with VR/AR, real-time 3D, and API-driven apps.

Some of my favorite projects involve Unity games, VR simulations, and hackathon builds, some with thousands of users or live deployments.
